HOW TO START MY PROGRAM:

To run the program, you will need Visual Studio downloaded onto your PC.
Start up Visual Studio and open up the project named "PROG_POE_ST10091197_KrystelleRupnarain".
Once started you may run the program.

DESCRIPTION:

The program allows one to enter their monthly income, income tax and expenditures. 
You then can enter whether you are renting or buying a property. 
The program will then calculate your monthly repayment and if you are renting, how likely a loan will be.
You can then decide to calculate how much amonth you would pay for a vehicle loan.
At the end, a report displaying expenses in descending order will be displayed.
The user can then decide if they would want to save up for a goal and how much they would need to save a month to reach the goal.

WHAT I CHANGED BASED OF MY LECTURER'S FEEDBACK:

For part 1 of the POE, I did not fully put all the expenses in the array, instead I only put the expenditures (a form of expenses) in the array.
To fix this, in part 2 when adding the expenses to the generic collection, I also added the other expenses that I had forgotten to it as well.
The expense list now includes the monthly rental amount, the monthly loan repayment, the monthly car repayment as well as the expenditures.

For part 2 of the POE, I had met all the expected requirements and so no extra feedback was needed for me to implement.
